### Planning
I started my project with setting up all requirements in Trello and definning user stories. As a user i want to...
* see all news with a related photo and a short brief of news in the main page with the published date and time.
* be able to use it on mobile browsers so it needs to be responsive.
* see a sign up page for creating a new user
* see a log in page for the users have been alredy registered
* CRUD news and attaching a photo
* be able to Log-out from my account

### Trello
Using **Trello** during any projects can be an excellent way to create a roadmap for the project so I used this powerful project managmnet tool in order to keep my project oragnised and well documented.
